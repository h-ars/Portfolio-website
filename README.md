# Portfolio-website
This is my personal portfolio website, built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It emphasizes device responsiveness, achieved using media queries, and features a minimalist, aesthetically pleasing design. With a focus on functionality, it presents concise, professional descriptions of myself and my work.
